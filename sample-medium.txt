[00:18:30] Participant: Maybe, maybe, like, a fish. But another fish, but it's bigger.
[00:18:42] Interviewer: Okay, let's do that. Let's do, I think we used Fish 1 and Fish 2. Shall we use Fish 3? Or shall we make the Fish 2 as the bigger fish? Which one would you prefer?
[00:18:48] Participant: I guess Fish 3 because it's different.
[00:18:48] Interviewer: Mm hmm, okay, perfect. So now, I will create. What shall we call this type of fish?
[00:19:11] Participant: Um, let's see, I don't know, big fish?
[00:19:25] Interviewer: How many big fish will be in this pond?
[00:19:41] Participant: Uh, I would say, like, 10.
[00:19:43] Interviewer: Let's see how does it look. Okay, they are too small right now. Is this big fish good? Is it big enough? Is it too small?
[00:19:53] Participant: That's pretty good size.
[00:19:54] Interviewer: And let's make them move to random places again. Okay, all the big fish are on top of each other. Now we have 10 big fish in the model. Will they act, pretty much, like the other fish? Just move around randomly, and then, they will just eat the other fishes?
[00:20:33] Participant: Right, right. Same as other fish, but, yeah, they just randomly eat the other fish, the smaller fish.
[00:20:52] Interviewer: Are they going to get caught by the fishermen?
[00:20:59] Participant: No, I don't, I don't think, I don't believe they will be caught.
[00:21:02] Interviewer: Mm hmm, and then, are they going to reproduce as well?
[00:21:12] Participant: Yes, but I will say it'll, you know, much slower rate than the smaller fish.
[00:21:20] Interviewer: Like, how slower? For example, 10 times slower? 100 times lower?
[00:21:25] Participant: And let's see, I will say, like, 100 times lower.
[00:21:30] Interviewer: Okay, and then, and this is going to be the code that that makes them eat the fish. So, let's see if they gobble up the fishes. What do you think?
[00:22:04] Participant: I'm trying to see, it looks like it's decreasing a lot. Oh, I see it's increasing, too. It looks like it's, because I wanted it to be more balanced.
[00:22:20] Interviewer: Mm hmm.
[00:22:21] Participant: Yeah, I mean, it looks like it's, it's getting there, though.
[00:22:26] Interviewer: Yeah, it did oscillate a little bit. It did go down a little bit, and then it did pick up a little bit. And then, yeah it's really interesting. It does seem like, so, did you want, like, a more, like, a straight line, instead of these ups and downs or?
[00:22:42] Participant: Um, if possible, well, more, like, because, I know they don't usually. , it doesn't seem so bad, the way it is. If possible, maybe if it's more smoothened. Because they just look like they're in a zigzag motion.
[00:23:05] Interviewer: Yeah, it's like the number of small fish increase or decrease a little bit and then, when it's too little, it starts increasing. That means, too much and it starts decreasing. Why do you think there is, ups and downs happen?
[00:23:22] Participant: It's constantly trying to balance out with over populating and then, you know, the bigger fish eating the fish. So, it's populating, it's trying, basically like an upward sloping repopulating. But you have the big fish and the fishermen that are making it go up and down.
[00:23:49] Interviewer: I will also, I also noticed that I made a small error that the big fish wouldn't eat the small fish when they touch but when they are exactly on the same square, which is making it a bit difficult for big fish to catch the small fish. If that was the intention you had, like, it's a bit harder for the big fish to gobble up the small fish. But if you wanted, for example, the big fish to immediately eat the small fish when they're really, like, touching each other, I can also try to make it like this, and we can see if it was like more impactful. Well, I implemented it that way. Small fish, really. So it's like I made the big fish. I made it easier for big fish to catch the small fish. On this one, there is other small fish disappearing. Let's try a little bit harder, but still easier than the original version. It does seem like, if the big fish can catch the small fish too easy, it just, they just catch all of them.
[00:25:07] Participant: Right, yes, I see that.
[00:25:09] Interviewer: Yeah, I probably should be reverting it to the original version. Yeah, there are, there are no fish left, and let's see the original version again. Very big fish, like, if they're close, they cannot eat, but they have to be, really, in the same spot, to be able to eat the small fish.
[00:25:50] Participant: I was also thinking, I don't know what would be higher than these bigger fish in this ecosystem, but I imagine, like, if it was like a crocodile, they would just get old and die, so I guess if this thing's for, some of them to randomly die, you know? And it'll be like a very rare occurrence, but it will happen. See?
[00:26:27] Interviewer: I will also see. It's implemented, too. Let me add the monitor that says cut off big fish. I know that's not the correct grammar, fishes. Fishes plural is fish but I just want to easily see. So, we, I was, I will just run it without making the changes to see if the big fish populate ever. Do you ever see a new big fish appearing? Are they really? So, we got the small fishes this time. Huh, no?
[00:27:15] Participant: Yeah, I don't really see it, or maybe it's just too fast or something.
[00:27:20] Interviewer: No, I'd sped it up normally. Okay, there was one big creature. Because it's very rare for the big fish to make new babies, it took about that much time. OK, I will do, they should die almost as frequently as they make a new baby.
[00:27:36] Participant: Yeah. It makes sense, since it's really rare.
[00:27:41] Interviewer: So, that's going to be the case as well. So, there's going to be, like, very tiny chance that either one big fish dies, or one big fish makes a copy of it. Basically it repopulates, and we can see here, the number of big fishes and... Do want me add big fishes to the plot as well? See, one of them died. You now have nine big fishes.
[00:28:04] Participant: Yeah.
[00:28:05] Interviewer: Just let me add that here, and then, maybe, like, let's make this a color that's easier to differentiate like this. This way, we can see, like, how many big fish, if there are any changes in the big fish over time and small fish always changes, of course. Yeah, this one caught a fish. Do you want it to be easier for the fishermen to catch fish, too, or do you think it's good right now?
[00:29:00] Participant: Um, I think, just looking at the fishermen, and it looks like they, they all come in at the same time, and they leave at the same time, I guess, maybe it could be more random to where they're not, where they come in. Some come in, where others don't, type of thing.
[00:29:29] Interviewer: So I made a very quick change, like, a very picky version of that. Let's see if this will work the way you wanted it to work and then, so, we will adjust it. For the others are really just not, okay, I made it too infrequent. Oh, I see okay. See, now one of them stayed. So, currently it's like, yeah, some of them. Does that make more sense? Does it look better?
[00:30:38] Participant: Yeah, that's a lot more random, as far as some stand, while others move.
[00:30:45] Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:30:51] Participant: Okay, it's looking more like the ideal of, my ideal. It's looking more natural.
[00:30:59] Interviewer: Yeah, I agree. It's looking more lively and more like, as quite complicated too. Oh, there's an error. Okay, it may sometimes throw a minor error that I forgot to look, like an edgecase error. it's also very interesting that, as you said, the plot doesn't stay the same, but it goes up and down.
[00:31:26] Participant: Yeah.
[00:31:27] Interviewer: Very cool. We still have, like, about 15 minutes. Do you have any other ideas that you would like to add to this model?
[00:31:39] Participant: Umm, not that I can think of. I don't know if it would take more time, but yeah, at the moment, I can't think of anything.
