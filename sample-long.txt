[00:00:00] Interviewer: Can we go off the record? Sorry, can we go off the record? I would like to share something with you, but I don't want it to be recorded and we can't do it. Yeah, so I turned off my camera too, so that you're not distracted, but I will start sharing my screen in a second. And usually what I do, in these meetings, the follow up meetings, is that I do ask you, can you tell me what you remember from our previous meeting?
[00:00:29] Participant: From our last meeting, we, we did a model and we chose to do the model, basically, modeling how it is, or giving an illustration of how it is when, uh, doing, you know, and the fishermen come to fish, and a pond and the progress of that and everything. So.
[00:00:57] Interviewer: Yeah, and do you, what did you think about that first meeting experience?
[00:01:07] Participant: Um. It was pretty neat to see how, how fish can increase and decrease like that because of them. And then to see fisherman, uh, being a part of the process, seeing how they decrease in the fish populating, to see how they increase. So, yeah, that was pretty neat.
[00:01:34] Interviewer: Yeah, I agree with you that was very neat. To just create something that lively within just one meeting with you. And, and then, did you think about, did you get a chance to think about your model, like, what would you like to add or change today?
[00:01:53] Participant: Yeah I, I was thinking about how I, because, I was looking at the model that you sent me. And like, it, uh it kept, I noticed, it kept increasing a lot, with as far as my population of the fish. So, um, I guess, like, I wanted to ask some things to target that.
[00:02:19] Interviewer: Mm hmm.
[00:02:20] Participant: And I was thinking, like, maybe, there could be more fisherman, maybe a couple, maybe, like, three more fishermen, to just randomly come in, because, I mean, I would think that's how it is in real life, with those different numbers of people to come in, so, probably more fishermen.
[00:02:42] Interviewer: Mm hmm. Do you see my screen, by the way right now?
[00:02:50] Participant: Yeah, I can see.
[00:02:51] Interviewer: Perfect, yeah, just to make sure. Yeah, and you are continuing your talk? Sorry, I interrupted.
[00:02:57] Participant: And another thing is, like, a bigger pond, I guess, to, like, because, you know, in my head, there's like 20 some fish, but because they're populating, it makes sense there to be more, so, yeah, bigger pond would, would fit that. And then, my last thing that I want, that I wrote down here to add, um, it's like between, you know, it's like slow or decrease or have some type of realistic effect of the fish population. I was thinking of, maybe a crocodile or something, to add a new type of fishy amphibian of some kind.
[00:03:48] Interviewer: Yeah that would be fun. Like, like it's not just humans catching fish, but there's, there's also, like, an ecosystem. Right, yeah. Let's start with this, and as we are implementing these, you can always change your thoughts. You can always add more things. I just wanted to note down your immediate thoughts, so that we don't forget those, but you can always come up with more ideas of. We can make this model as simple or as complicated as you want. It really is up to you to just decide what. Would you like it to look like? What would you like to have in there? So let's start with the pond. I think it's the easiest to do. I will make the font bigger and bigger, and you tell me if it's big enough, or if it's the size you wanted. So, it can be this. It can be little bit bigger. It can be much larger. Do you prefer this much larger one or?
[00:04:44] Participant: Yeah, I like this one, cause you can really see the focus of everything, yeah.
[00:04:50] Interviewer: Perfect, and then I will actually, right, to make it a bit more irregular. Is it better to be a bit more irregular like this?
[00:05:04] Participant: Yeah, that's fine.
[00:05:05] Interviewer: Yeah, that's a bit more irregular. There are like little patches and stuff. So that we did. Let's add more fishermen, and you mentioned that, so we have these five fishermen, I think. Are they always staying here, or are they coming and going at times?
[00:05:22] Participant: Um, I would think the five fishermen, would, you know, maybe, they're coming and going, but, but then, they're like, maybe, three other fishermen that, that you know they have. They come by random, so sometimes there would be, I guess, there would be between eight and five. Five that definitely come, but the other three are random.
[00:05:51] Interviewer: So that will be something, like, let me show you how I implemented your idea. So here, you see that there are, like, five and it used to be always five. But now, every time we click setup, it will be a different number, right now, which is seven. Seven again. It's six this time, this time. Does it, does it work the way you want?
[00:06:24] Participant: Yeah, that's cool.
[00:06:26] Interviewer: And now, let's make the fishermen come and go at random. Do they come and go at random times, or periodically? Is there, like, a specific interval?
[00:06:34] Participant: Umm, I would think, like, maybe, I don't know, how you put this, but maybe, like, as it goes to nighttime or like even in time, like, you know, I don't know, how that would because there's no sky.
[00:06:52] Interviewer: Yeah, we can do that. We can do that. So let's give it a try. So let me add that too. So there is almost like a day cycle, right?
[00:07:01] Participant: Right.
[00:07:07] Interviewer: And how long does the day and how long is the night?
[00:07:12] Participant: Um I guess, I, see, I don't know, maybe an hour? As far as, just, or, I don't know, how would, how could that be?
[00:07:27] Interviewer: Well, it doesn't have to be an exactly perfect number. It can be something that you just feel like sounds right, right, for example. And do you want the fishermen to spend five hours next to the water, and another five hours out, in reading outside? Do you want them to spend two hours, two hours next to water? Two hours outside. Two hours next to water, five hours outside, like, ground numbers can be as different as you want them to be. And then we can implement them, and if it doesn't feel right for you, you can change it too.
[00:08:02] Participant: Yeah, okay, so I was, like, a day's time could be an hour and a night's time be an hour.
[00:08:17] Interviewer: Let's do this. The other one is, so the fishermen will know where they are fishing, or, you know, let's, let's make them. Do you want them to go back to the exact position that they were fishing, or do you want them to just come out to a random spot and then go to another random spot by the water? And then come out to a random spot and then go to a random spot by the water? Do you want them to change their spots, as they are coming and going, or do you want them to always go back to the original position?
[00:08:53] Participant: Umm, maybe some of them could go back to their original position, but for the most part, I'd say, like, over half of them could, like, go to different spots.
[00:09:07] Interviewer: Okay, so let's do it that way. Okay, so, I don't need that, and then, what will happen is... OK. So, as fishermen, I see something, like. Let me try, and then we will readjust, because it's probably not going to look perfect, the first version of the code I wrote, right?
[00:09:48] Participant: Okay.
[00:09:49] Interviewer: Yeah, I will say, if they are by the water, which they will all be, initially, right? I will say. There, by the water, they will say, okay, I spent an hour here, which we currently estimate to 10 ticks, but we may make it 100 ticks, meaning one hour, solely up to us to say how long does an hour last, too. So I'm not going to be biased, and then I will choose. On the grass, [when] they were not by the water, they will do the exact opposite. Let's see how it works. So let's see how it works. It's probably going to be too quick. They will go and, okay, something happened. Okay. hey. I implemented that error, so let me fix that. The color is green and blue. Ah, I made that mistake. It is like, a little bit of a tricky one to implement here, because I want them to just go a little bit outside the water, so we can definitely see that they are not on the water. Let me actually make this world right. Maybe that will help. So they go, they come back. They go, they come back, and they are changing their spots, most of the time, as you said. They are sticking around in their areas. Is it too quick to go and come back?
[00:14:47] Participant: Um, I guess, given the days, only an hour, I guess.
[00:14:53] Interviewer: Okay. But if you want, we can make them read outside more and spend more time by the water.
[00:15:02] Participant: Okay, yeah.
[00:15:04] Interviewer: Okay, let's try this one, for example. So, this one will be, they will be by the water for a little bit. They will be away from the water for a little bit, and let's make them be a bit more away from the water, so that we can easily see that they are away from the water. Oh. Okay, I think I have a tiny bug. Okay, so, yeah. They're all away from the water. And then something happens because one's going. I still think I have a minor bug bug in this one. Okay, yes, I found a bug here, because they were not like coming back to the lakeside. So a hundred ticks pass, they take a step back,. Another hundred ticks pass, they come back to the water. They take a step back, spend some time. They come back. I guess them taking time off really made the fish, like, populate a lot. I will implement a minor thing, if you allow me, so that if there are a number of fish increases too much, the model will stop so that the computer doesn't slow too much. I'd say, if it's, if there are more than 200 fish, which we started with just twenty. Yeah, with twenty fishes, if there are more than 200 fish, the model will just stop, because it's, like, it's going to keep increasing. So now our fishermen are going, coming back, going and coming back and then, and when they are by the water, fish gets caught sometimes, and when they are, when they are away from the water, the fish populates. We implemented that, more fisherman randomly come in a bigger pond. Let's make a crocodile and we did the day and night cycle, too. I don't know if we have a crocodile shape, but let's look at the shapes we have, and see if we have something similar. That will be helpful. So, let's see, we have, let us slowly go... There's a bug that we can change to look like a crocodile a little bit. Umm, there's a caterpillar, kind of looks like a crocodile little bit. there's a cow skull that might look like a crocodile a little bit. I don't think we have a, we definitely don't have a crocodile.
[00:18:30] Participant: Maybe, maybe, like, a fish. But another fish, but it's bigger.
[00:18:42] Interviewer: Okay, let's do that. Let's do, I think we used Fish 1 and Fish 2. Shall we use Fish 3? Or shall we make the Fish 2 as the bigger fish? Which one would you prefer?
[00:18:48] Participant: I guess Fish 3 because it's different.
[00:18:48] Interviewer: Mm hmm, okay, perfect. So now, I will create. What shall we call this type of fish?
[00:19:11] Participant: Um, let's see, I don't know, big fish?
[00:19:25] Interviewer: How many big fish will be in this pond?
[00:19:41] Participant: Uh, I would say, like, 10.
[00:19:43] Interviewer: Let's see how does it look. Okay, they are too small right now. Is this big fish good? Is it big enough? Is it too small?
[00:19:53] Participant: That's pretty good size.
[00:19:54] Interviewer: And let's make them move to random places again. Okay, all the big fish are on top of each other. Now we have 10 big fish in the model. Will they act, pretty much, like the other fish? Just move around randomly, and then, they will just eat the other fishes?
[00:20:33] Participant: Right, right. Same as other fish, but, yeah, they just randomly eat the other fish, the smaller fish.
[00:20:52] Interviewer: Are they going to get caught by the fishermen?
[00:20:59] Participant: No, I don't, I don't think, I don't believe they will be caught.
[00:21:02] Interviewer: Mm hmm, and then, are they going to reproduce as well?
[00:21:12] Participant: Yes, but I will say it'll, you know, much slower rate than the smaller fish.
[00:21:20] Interviewer: Like, how slower? For example, 10 times slower? 100 times lower?
[00:21:25] Participant: And let's see, I will say, like, 100 times lower.
[00:21:30] Interviewer: Okay, and then, and this is going to be the code that that makes them eat the fish. So, let's see if they gobble up the fishes. What do you think?
[00:22:04] Participant: I'm trying to see, it looks like it's decreasing a lot. Oh, I see it's increasing, too. It looks like it's, because I wanted it to be more balanced.
[00:22:20] Interviewer: Mm hmm.
[00:22:21] Participant: Yeah, I mean, it looks like it's, it's getting there, though.
[00:22:26] Interviewer: Yeah, it did oscillate a little bit. It did go down a little bit, and then it did pick up a little bit. And then, yeah it's really interesting. It does seem like, so, did you want, like, a more, like, a straight line, instead of these ups and downs or?
[00:22:42] Participant: Um, if possible, well, more, like, because, I know they don't usually. , it doesn't seem so bad, the way it is. If possible, maybe if it's more smoothened. Because they just look like they're in a zigzag motion.
[00:23:05] Interviewer: Yeah, it's like the number of small fish increase or decrease a little bit and then, when it's too little, it starts increasing. That means, too much and it starts decreasing. Why do you think there is, ups and downs happen?
[00:23:22] Participant: It's constantly trying to balance out with over populating and then, you know, the bigger fish eating the fish. So, it's populating, it's trying, basically like an upward sloping repopulating. But you have the big fish and the fishermen that are making it go up and down.
[00:23:49] Interviewer: I will also, I also noticed that I made a small error that the big fish wouldn't eat the small fish when they touch but when they are exactly on the same square, which is making it a bit difficult for big fish to catch the small fish. If that was the intention you had, like, it's a bit harder for the big fish to gobble up the small fish. But if you wanted, for example, the big fish to immediately eat the small fish when they're really, like, touching each other, I can also try to make it like this, and we can see if it was like more impactful. Well, I implemented it that way. Small fish, really. So it's like I made the big fish. I made it easier for big fish to catch the small fish. On this one, there is other small fish disappearing. Let's try a little bit harder, but still easier than the original version. It does seem like, if the big fish can catch the small fish too easy, it just, they just catch all of them.
[00:25:07] Participant: Right, yes, I see that.
[00:25:09] Interviewer: Yeah, I probably should be reverting it to the original version. Yeah, there are, there are no fish left, and let's see the original version again. Very big fish, like, if they're close, they cannot eat, but they have to be, really, in the same spot, to be able to eat the small fish.
[00:25:50] Participant: I was also thinking, I don't know what would be higher than these bigger fish in this ecosystem, but I imagine, like, if it was like a crocodile, they would just get old and die, so I guess if this thing's for, some of them to randomly die, you know? And it'll be like a very rare occurrence, but it will happen. See?
[00:26:27] Interviewer: I will also see. It's implemented, too. Let me add the monitor that says cut off big fish. I know that's not the correct grammar, fishes. Fishes plural is fish but I just want to easily see. So, we, I was, I will just run it without making the changes to see if the big fish populate ever. Do you ever see a new big fish appearing? Are they really? So, we got the small fishes this time. Huh, no?
[00:27:15] Participant: Yeah, I don't really see it, or maybe it's just too fast or something.
[00:27:20] Interviewer: No, I'd sped it up normally. Okay, there was one big creature. Because it's very rare for the big fish to make new babies, it took about that much time. OK, I will do, they should die almost as frequently as they make a new baby.
[00:27:36] Participant: Yeah. It makes sense, since it's really rare.
[00:27:41] Interviewer: So, that's going to be the case as well. So, there's going to be, like, very tiny chance that either one big fish dies, or one big fish makes a copy of it. Basically it repopulates, and we can see here, the number of big fishes and... Do want me add big fishes to the plot as well? See, one of them died. You now have nine big fishes.
[00:28:04] Participant: Yeah.
[00:28:05] Interviewer: Just let me add that here, and then, maybe, like, let's make this a color that's easier to differentiate like this. This way, we can see, like, how many big fish, if there are any changes in the big fish over time and small fish always changes, of course. Yeah, this one caught a fish. Do you want it to be easier for the fishermen to catch fish, too, or do you think it's good right now?
[00:29:00] Participant: Um, I think, just looking at the fishermen, and it looks like they, they all come in at the same time, and they leave at the same time, I guess, maybe it could be more random to where they're not, where they come in. Some come in, where others don't, type of thing.
[00:29:29] Interviewer: So I made a very quick change, like, a very picky version of that. Let's see if this will work the way you wanted it to work and then, so, we will adjust it. For the others are really just not, okay, I made it too infrequent. Oh, I see okay. See, now one of them stayed. So, currently it's like, yeah, some of them. Does that make more sense? Does it look better?
[00:30:38] Participant: Yeah, that's a lot more random, as far as some stand, while others move.
[00:30:45] Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:30:51] Participant: Okay, it's looking more like the ideal of, my ideal. It's looking more natural.
[00:30:59] Interviewer: Yeah, I agree. It's looking more lively and more like, as quite complicated too. Oh, there's an error. Okay, it may sometimes throw a minor error that I forgot to look, like an edgecase error. it's also very interesting that, as you said, the plot doesn't stay the same, but it goes up and down.
[00:31:26] Participant: Yeah.
[00:31:27] Interviewer: Very cool. We still have, like, about 15 minutes. Do you have any other ideas that you would like to add to this model?
[00:31:39] Participant: Umm, not that I can think of. I don't know if it would take more time, but yeah, at the moment, I can't think of anything.
[00:31:49] Interviewer: Mm hmm. Yeah, I mean, perfectly fine, if you don't want that anything else but just want to make sure you know, like, you can implement anything that you want to implement in the model. Great so. The process is, if you do not have any more ideas to add, add, we pause anytime you would like to pause this meeting, and then we do one more meeting where we just look at the model and discuss the model and discuss this process that we went through together, like you describing your ideas and me building this model for you. Then we just reflect on the process and effect on the model.
[00:32:29] Participant: Okay.
[00:32:30] Interviewer: Mm hmm. Before we end, I had a question, but I forgot because I started noticing that the number of fish increased a lot for this one. As I did for the previous one, I will send you this version as a link, too. I will, basically, update the same name with this version, and then I will. send you a message on our network. Yeah we did more fishermen and then made a bigger pond, maybe a crocodile eating fish, etc. Perfect, well, um, do you have any other thoughts at the moment about the model?
[00:33:10] Participant: Uh, I guess, like, I can't figure out why... Well, I can I can figure out why, but, like, it just keeps increasing, like, with the, I don't know. I kept looking for a balance there, and it seems like it's harder to find.
[00:33:30] Interviewer: Why, why, what do you think will...? We can tweak, tweak the model's parameters, all of it. What do you think would make it more balanced?
[00:33:37] Participant: I don't know, like, I don't, maybe less of the fishermen moving out?
[00:33:46] Interviewer: Okay.
[00:33:47] Participant: Or, I guess, that would add to it?
[00:33:51] Interviewer: Okay, perfect.
[00:33:53] Participant: As I mentioned, if they're there, they will be there to fish, instead of just standing next to it, so, yes, I guess that would be more natural.
[00:34:05] Interviewer: Mm hmm. There's also, maybe, I mean, it's been quite a bit of stuff. There's also a little bit of code we wrote that makes it harder for the fishermen to catch any fish at any given time. Every time a fish comes close to a fisherman, there's a 40% chance that the fish will be caught. It's not 100% that a fisherman doesn't catch a fish. Uh, you want to keep that, right?
[00:34:31] Participant: Uh, yeah, uh, maybe they can catch the big fish, too? But it's an even lesser chance, just for the sake of a big fish being there for the, to decrease the population is a small fish.
[00:34:50] Interviewer: Let's do that. It's, like, much, much, much smaller chance, right?
[00:34:59] Participant: Right, much smaller.
[00:35:00] Interviewer: Maybe, like, 5% chance at any given time, instead of 40% chance for the other fish. Okay, and I, and we said, we were going to make fishermen, less fisherman, to leave at any given Pack.
[00:35:17] Participant: Yeah.
[00:35:23] Interviewer: Okay. I will fix it, so that, like every time one of them, or two of them, however many we want, to leave instead of, again, randomly... Let's see now, let's see now... So every now and then now, only one of them will take a hike and then come back Okay, this one is making an error. Sorry, pause. Nothing in there. No. Okay, so I have to start again. I got a little bug... One of them will take off. I think this one took off, but not really. This one took off again. Yeah. And then, yeah, it's like they are not leaving as much this one took off from the top right, but it's not, it's going to be more efficient at any given time. Do you want two of them to take off, one of them, to take off, like it's happening right now,? Two of them to take off? Three of them to take off? What do you think will be the better?
[00:37:29] Participant: Umm, maybe, like, two of them taking off.
[00:37:29] Interviewer: Mm hmm, yeah. OK, so, I did again, write the code in the wrong place. Two of them left. At any time, two of them will be not fishing, and the rest will be fishing. So, there's always going to be, like, and also, of course, every time we run the model, there's a random number of fishermen, right? Right now, we have six fishermen in this version of the model. Sometimes we have five fishermen, sometimes we have six, sometimes we have eight, right? Because you needed, like, random compared to eight. Two at the bottom are taking off right now, right? Excellent. Okay. What do you think?
[00:38:59] Participant: Um it's... Yeah, I mean, I like how it is. It's still the... No, maybe, it's just the population amount is too high or something for the little fish.
[00:40:01] Interviewer: Mm hmm, it grows quite a bit. What can we change to make it more balanced? What should we change it?
[00:40:09] Participant: Umm, because I know the big fish, like, they're helping to decrease it. I guess I want to say, more big fish.
[00:40:33] Interviewer: Yeah, let's add that. How many?
[00:40:37] Participant: Probably, like, five more.
[00:40:40] Interviewer: Okay, let's see.
[00:41:02] Participant: It looks like it's kind of balancing out.
[00:41:06] Interviewer: Yeah, I agree. Okay, let me fix this little part of the, as well... I don't want to hear that error again. Because every time we run it, some things are randomized, right? Like, there maybe, sometimes, more fishermen, less fishermen. There's, like, just by random chance, more big fish, less big fish, etc, so it may be different every single time. Why did you stop? Okay sorry about that. Very interesting... The big fish ate all the small fish in this time.
[00:42:24] Participant: Okay.
[00:42:29] Interviewer: So I think this is, like, a really interesting point for us to pause, and then I will send this, oh, okay, is happening more, like, regularly, the big fish eating all the small ones?
[00:42:42] Participant: I guess so, yeah. I guess, too many big fish.
[00:42:47] Interviewer: Too many big fish? So, we had 10 initially. We made them 15 of them. How many should we change it to them?
[00:42:57] Participant: I guess like 12, instead.
[00:42:59] Interviewer: Let's make it 12. It's very interesting, really small changes make a big difference, right? Why do you think that's the case?
[00:43:13] Participant: Uh, because the big fish are, I think, the fish are more, the big fish are more of an effect on the little fish than the fishermen are. So, yeah, that, that's probably what it is.
[00:43:30] Interviewer: True. Yeah, I find it fascinating the little changes that happen with the small changes that we make in the code, so. Okay, perfect. Now, it is more balanced, I think this is, like, a better stopping point. I will save this version, as I have already sent you the link, I want you to just, again, like, if you have time, you don't have to, but if you have time, to tinker with it like you did this, this, after this past meeting. And the next meeting, we will, if you have any ideas, any additional, if you come up with an additional ideas, we can implement those. Definitely, in the next meeting, and we will wrap up with some reflection of this process. We'll just talk about what you think about this process, what you thought about your model, you know, like that kind of things. I just want to get your feedback and reflections on the record. And do anything else you would like to say, before I stop recording?
[00:44:28] Participant: I don't think so.
[00:44:31] Interviewer: Okay, let's stop this sharing.
