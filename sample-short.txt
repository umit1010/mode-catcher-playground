[00:09:54] Interviewer: OK, so the very first question is, like, as usual, as I do. And because we took quite some breaks. Can you tell me about the original question you had in your mind one, one last time?
[00:10:06] Participant: Sure. Okay, so the original question was, which, so, basically the question started with a real life situation that I experienced, where I was helping to deliver water, packets of water bottles from a truck on this on the road to a church, and there was a group of people and we all collectively had to decide whether we would carry the bottles individually into the church or if we would create an assembly line. And there was some back and forth and ultimately we decided to create an assembly line. So the inspiration for modeling. This was to look at the different things at stake with these two methods, which, yeah, I think most importantly it was safety with regards to corona, potential corona exposure. But then kind of not unimportant, maybe second most important, what, a question was, was efficiency. So, I mean, or, or "what would", "how long it would take to do the task?" because time is limited. And then I think the third consideration was "what's going to be easiest?", "what's going to be, what's going to be more work for everybody?" so, I think we were able to break it down into amount of steps taken for each person, which represents the, the amount of work. Bottles carried over a certain amount of time, which represents the total. What would you do you know what we would call that output? Or?
