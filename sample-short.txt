[00:29:00] Participant: Um, I think, just looking at the fishermen, and it looks like they, they all come in at the same time, and they leave at the same time, I guess, maybe it could be more random to where they're not, where they come in. Some come in, where others don't, type of thing.
[00:29:29] Interviewer: So I made a very quick change, like, a very picky version of that. Let's see if this will work the way you wanted it to work and then, so, we will adjust it. For the others are really just not, okay, I made it too infrequent. Oh, I see okay. See, now one of them stayed. So, currently it's like, yeah, some of them. Does that make more sense? Does it look better?
[00:30:38] Participant: Yeah, that's a lot more random, as far as some stand, while others move.
[00:30:45] Interviewer: Yeah.
[00:30:51] Participant: Okay, it's looking more like the ideal of, my ideal. It's looking more natural.
[00:30:59] Interviewer: Yeah, I agree. It's looking more lively and more like, as quite complicated too. Oh, there's an error. Okay, it may sometimes throw a minor error that I forgot to look, like an edgecase error. it's also very interesting that, as you said, the plot doesn't stay the same, but it goes up and down.
[00:31:26] Participant: Yeah.
[00:31:27] Interviewer: Very cool. We still have, like, about 15 minutes. Do you have any other ideas that you would like to add to this model?
[00:31:39] Participant: Umm, not that I can think of. I don't know if it would take more time, but yeah, at the moment, I can't think of anything.
