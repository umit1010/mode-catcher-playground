[00:03:12] Participant Cory: Um, there are fish in the pond.
[00:03:17] Interviewer: Okay, let's add some fish. I will define.
[00:03:24] Participant Cory: I'll say, like, I don't know, 20 fish.
[00:03:28] Interviewer: So I do remember, we have a fish shape. But let me, let me see if we do have it, and you can also, you know, you don't have to make them look like the fish shape. So there is this fish shape, if it works for you. But you can make them any shape. You can draw a shape, if the fish shape doesn't work for you. And we also have some additional shapes in the library and see if there are other fish shapes too. Surely, there must be some other. So there is this second fish. There's this third fish. So there are three fish shapes. These two. So there's this fish shape, the smaller, and then there's this fish shape, even more colored fish, colorful fish. There's just plain fish. Which, which color shape will be better for you?
[00:04:40] Participant Cory: Can you add two different fish?.
[00:04:40] Interviewer: Yeah, of course.
[00:04:40] Participant Cory: So maybe like out of the 20, I will say, like, 18 of them be the first type of fish. Yeah. Then the rest of them be fish two.
[00:04:57] Interviewer: Okay, that.
[00:04:58] Participant Cory: Just to add that little diversity, I guess.
[00:05:10] Interviewer: Make sure that two fishes are not in the same spot. Are they going to be random colors or just a specific color?
[00:05:22] Participant Cory: Umm, random colors.
[00:05:24] Interviewer: Okay, perfect. So let's see how it looks. Okay, sorry, I got the wrong call. So, do they look too small? Do they look good? I can also zoom in.
[00:06:02] Participant Cory: Maybe I should have made the pond a little bigger, maybe.
[00:06:06] Interviewer: Sure, let's make it, like, even bigger. How about now?
[00:06:12] Participant Cory: Yeah, yeah, that's better.
[00:06:14] Interviewer: Do you want this fish to be this small or large?
[00:06:20] Participant Cory: Yeah, probably, yeah, just a little bigger, the fish, a little bigger too.
[00:06:29] Interviewer: Is this better or a bit bigger?
[00:06:34] Participant Cory: Yes, that's better.
[00:06:36] Interviewer: Okay. And, oh, I know how to grow this, sorry. I can't really, like, make it larger for you to be able to see easier. Also, what's next? We have a pond, we have fish. What do we add more?
[00:06:52] Participant Cory: And then, maybe, like, five fishermen who just fish every weekend.
[00:07:05] Interviewer: So, in terms of the shape for the fishermen, we can use the simple human person shape that. We can also, we also have a bunch of other people shapes. So we have person, business, construction, doctor, former graduate, and we can also edit these, you know, like, we can make it take the lumberjack and remove the axe, for example. Service, soldier, student, or just a simple person.
[00:07:36] Participant Cory: Um, maybe, if it's possible, if one of them could be, like, holding something, you know, to make it look like there's, like, a fisherline going down.
[00:07:47] Interviewer: Just make it better. So I will remove this these, like, little things from the farmer, and I will take the head out as well. Okay. With this to... Actually, let's use the simple one, and now let's put, like, a fish at fishing line, is that right?
[00:08:12] Participant Cory: Yes. Even like a fishing pole, with a line coming from it.
[00:08:21] Interviewer: Let's do it. So, something like this. This is the fishing pole and line of, sorry. Oh, okay. Like something like this, right? Like, I mean, I'm gonna do it very, like, it's not going to be great. But just to represent an in between I can edit that, and then let's put another circle to represent, I don't know, the terms, but does it good?
[00:09:11] Participant Cory: Yeah, that looks, yeah, that's, that's pretty close.
[00:09:16] Interviewer: Okay, so, I will, you said five people by a fisherman?
[00:09:22] Participant Cory: Yes, probably, like, surrounding the pond.
