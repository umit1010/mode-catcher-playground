[00:00:14] Interviewer: So, what will happen if you flip this coin once?
[00:00:17] Participant: I will either get heads or tails. 
[00:00:19] Interviewer: How do you know that? 
[00:00:20] Participant: Because one side is heads and the other side is tails. So, you have 50% chance when it's falling for it land on one side or the other. 
[00:00:28] Interviewer: 50%, right? 
[00:00:29] Participant: Yes.
[00:00:30] Interviewer: Why is it 50%? 
[00:00:32] Participant: That's half. 
[00:00:34] Interviewer: That's half. OK. I see. So, is getting any of them equal? 
[00:00:38] Participant: Yes. 
[00:00:41] Interviewer: Go ahead flip that. It's head. Cool. So, what if you flip this again?
[00:00:51] Participant: It still has the same amount of probability to get heads or the tails. Does not matter what this was. 
[00:00:58] Interviewer: OK. So, would you go like go ahead and pick one or would you say "we can't know that"? 
[00:01:07] Participant: I can pick one but it's still the same chance that I might get the other one. Like I could say "it's going to be heads again" because the way I throw it might make it more likely to land on heads again, which is like a human error thing, but really it is just the same type of... 
[00:01:27] Interviewer: OK. What if you flipped this coin over and over again? Let's say 10 times. What would be the result? 
[00:01:34] Participant: Hypothetically five to five but it's probably going to be different than that because it's not a large enough trial. it's more likely to be half and half exactly if you flip it 500 times, than you would see 250 and 250. 
[00:01:50] Interviewer: I see, but if you try it just ten times, 5 and 5 is not that likely? 
[00:01:54] Participant: Well, 5 and 5 is still, it, like, cause because each time you flip it there is a 50% chance it could be something. So, when you, if you get the answer of 5 times heads and 5 times tails, the probability is a little bit different cause you would like multiply... 
[00:02:14] Interviewer: Yeah. It's mathematics, right? 
[00:02:15] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:02:16] Interviewer: Do you remember mathematics from school on that? 
[00:02:19] Participant: A little. It's like n factorial, the point five to the power. But, I would just do it like point five times point five times point five times ... 
[00:02:30] Interviewer: You multiply it, right? 
[00:02:31] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:02:33] Interviewer: So, what about you flip it 10 times and you get 9 heads and 1 tails. Is it likely? 
[00:02:40] Participant: Yeah, that can happen. 
[00:02:41] Interviewer: Like, how likely is it? 
[00:02:43] Participant: It is less likely than getting 5 and 5 cause it means getting heads 9 times which is ... 
[00:02:50] Interviewer: What about 6 and 4 versus 5 and 5? 
[00:02:52] Participant: I think that's a little bit more likely to get 6 and 4 than 5 and 5. 
[00:02:57] Interviewer: OK. What about 7 and 3? 
[00:03:01] Participant: I think the farther away it gets from half and half, it is less likely ... 
[00:03:06] Interviewer: I see, but 6 and 4 is more likely than 5 and 5? 
[00:03:08] Participant: No. I think 5 and 5 is ... I donâ€™t know. 
[00:03:11] Interviewer: So, how do you think about this stuff when you have to? 
[00:03:18] Participant: I guess the way I think about is, so, if I am just going to think about just one flip than it's half and half. But if I think it is multiple flips, I know from school and also from experience that it is more complicated than that because I know that when I flip it 10 times now I probably am not going to get 5 and 5. But that does not mean that each is still not 50% chance. It just means that each time it's 50% chance and so I know it's a little more complicated than that. 
[00:03:52] Interviewer: So, what instead of flipping a coin 10 times successively, flipping 10 coins at the same time. Are these two experiments the same? 
[00:04:00] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:04:03] Interviewer: I see. OK. I have some more. So this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and ten. So we have 10...
[00:04:14] Participant: We need one more. 
[00:04:14] Interviewer: Is that 9. Oh, my bad English. So, here is the thing. What would happen when you flip all these at once?
[00:04:25] Participant: Each one will have 50% chance of having ... 
[00:04:32] Interviewer: But what would be the cumulative outcome? 
[00:04:33] Participant: It could be anything. 
[00:04:34] Interviewer: Is it possible to get 10 heads? 
[00:04:35] Participant: Yeah. Not very likely but probable. 
[00:04:39] Interviewer: Not compared to, let's say, 5 and 5? 
[00:04:41] Participant: It is less likely. 
[00:04:43] Interviewer: 5 and 5 is more likely? 
[00:04:44] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:04:45] Interviewer: OK. What about 6 and 4? 
[00:04:47] Participant: I think it's also likely, maybe less likely than 5 and 5 but still very likely. The same thing with 7 and 8. And then it gets lower and lower, less likely the closer being so many more of one. 
[00:05:01] Interviewer: What would be your guess? 
[00:05:02] Participant: Hmm. I am going to guess 6 tails and 4 heads. 
[00:05:07] Interviewer: Go ahead. 
[00:05:08] Participant: All of them? 
[00:05:10] Interviewer: Yeah. Go drive all the people crazy. 
[00:05:13] Participant: Yeah.
[00:05:22] Participant: One, two three, four, five, six, seven. I said 4 heads and 6 tails and it was 3 and 7. That was pretty close.
[00:05:36] Interviewer: Pretty close. Were you surprised by this outcome? 
[00:05:40] Participant: No. I mean its all just likelihood, right? If I did again, I don't think I get 3 and 7 again, unless there is some sort of bias in how I throw it. 
[00:05:54] Interviewer: Let's say it's a fair experiment. Let's think that these are all fair ... 
[00:05:59] Participant: Then it would be very unlikely to get the same result again but I would get a different combination. 
[00:06:04] Interviewer: Hmm. I see. OK. What if you flip them again? 
[00:06:06] Participant: I don't know. Maybe I will get 4 tails and 4 heads. 
[00:06:14] Interviewer: Let's say it does not matter for us which one is which one but the probability of comparison of the ratio of them. So, 4 and 6 again? Go ahead try again. 
[00:06:35] Participant: So this time we have five and five! Hmm. That makes sense.
[00:06:45] Interviewer: Why did not you go with 5 and 5? Isn't that the most likely outcome? 
[00:06:48] Participant: Yeah. Umm. I don't know. I guess I did not go with 5 and 5 because it's ... I feel like I'm used to used to they did not being easy, like, I'm expect it to not be what I expect because I know that probability sort of makes things seem weird sometimes even though they are not weird.
[00:07:11] Interviewer: I see. Can you just explain it a little bit more. Why are you not going with the expected value? 
[00:07:18] Participant: So, because I guess in my experience the experimental value like what actually happens end up being different than the theoretical value of what should happen and so I was predicting it would be a little bit off than what expected that seems to be my experience with those sort of things. 
[00:07:36] Interviewer: I see, so what is the theoretical value? Where do you get that theoretical value? 
[00:07:41] Participant: The theoretical value is if like everything was perfectly fair and equal and amazing and everything was great and then you would get 50-50. But I just know that in real life it's not as simple as that. 
[00:07:52] Interviewer: So if everything was equally likely and everything was perfect, will we get 5 and 5 in each trial with these ten coins? 
[00:08:04] Participant: No but yes. Like, if I did the trials 1000 times, on average you would always be getting 5 and 5. But that does not mean that each individual trial, that scale, it would be different. 
[00:08:20] Interviewer: So, individual trials are different than multiple trials? So, why did you say 1000 for example? 
[00:08:27] Participant: Because I know it just has to be really big number in order to stop saying, in order to see it's like at the right scale. 
[00:08:34] Interviewer: Did you ever try 10000 coin flips? 
[00:08:36] Participant: No but I know you can, I haven't done it, but you can like automate it on the computer, it can do it 1000 times and give you the results. 
[00:08:44] Interviewer: But how do you get the theoretical understanding? Why do you say 1000 instead of, let's say, 1 million? 
[00:08:51] Participant: I guess I did not say 1 million because I don't think it has to be that big. Also, it's a lot of times throwing coins in the air. Umm, I did not say 100 because I guess I think of, maybe, I don't think of 100 being as many trials, like if I only had 100 students it would still be weird to generalize tat but if I had 1000 students, I think there is like a little bit more substance to that. 
[00:09:22] Interviewer: OK. What about, so, as we get bigger numbers we get closer to like the expected value, theoretical value, if that's what you mean. What about 1000 and 10000 for example? Which one is closer? 
[00:09:37] Participant: 10000. 
[00:09:38] Interviewer: OK, is there a difference or is it like .... 
[00:09:41] Participant: Umm, I think the more trials is always better, but it's going to sort of like reach to like an asymptote. So, you don't need 10000 because the difference between 10000 and 1000 aren't going to be very different, while the differences between 10 and 100 are going to be huge, and the difference between 100 and 1000 is also going to be big, but then like graph sort of goes like that it'll reach an asymptotes. So, it is better to do 10000, but you don't always have to.
[00:10:13] Interviewer: Is it better to do it until infinity? 
[00:10:16] Participant: Yeah, hypothetically. 
[00:10:17] Interviewer: So, is it like the mathematical concept of limit? 
[00:10:19] Participant: Yeah. But if in reality I would never do that because either it would crash my computer or I would just get really bored because there is not that big of a difference. 
[00:10:30] Interviewer: Let's say we are crazy people and we just want to learn the truth. Would you go and write a computer program to check that? 
[00:10:36] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:10:38] Interviewer: Why don't you do that in NetLogo right now?
