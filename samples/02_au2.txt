[00:10:38] Interviewer: Why don't you do that in NetLogo right now?
[00:19:03] Interviewer: So, can you stop it right now? Can you interpret these numbers to me?
[00:19:08] Participant: Yeah. This is saying that over all of the ticks, there is a forty nine percent chance they being heads and 51% of they being tails. 
[00:19:21] Interviewer: So, was this something you expected? 
[00:19:24] Participant: I was expecting it to be closer to 50-50. 
[00:19:26] Interviewer: Why did you expect it to be close to 50-50? 
[00:19:29] Participant: Because it's so many ticks, so it's a lot of trials. 
[00:19:32] Interviewer: So, it's like, wow, it's like 125 thousand ticks, right? So, we exceeded your 1000 ticks and it's still not there. 
[00:19:42] Participant: Nope. But it's close. See, look, this is growing and this is shrinking.
[00:19:49] Interviewer: Can you stop it again? So, you said it's growing and shrinking. What does that mean?
[00:19:55] Participant: Like this is moving closer to 50 and this is moving closer to 50. This used to be 48 and now it's 49 heads and this also dropping closer to 50 ...
[00:20:04] Interviewer: So they will, like, at some point converge to 50? 
[00:20:07] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:20:07] Interviewer: How long do we have to go to get to 50-50? 
[00:20:10] Participant: Well, I thought 1000, so clearly I was off with that. Maybe a million but I don't know. 
[00:20:17] Interviewer: Would you be surprised if it does not get to 50-50 when it's 1 million? Is there a probability of it not getting to 50-50 at 1 million ticks? 
[00:20:24] Participant: Yeah. Each tick is its own separate experiment and so there is... 
[00:20:33] Interviewer: So there is a probability of it happening? 
[00:20:34] Participant: There is a chance. 
[00:20:36] Interviewer: How do you decide, how do you think about that? Do you use theory? do you use mathematics? 
[00:20:44] Participant: Umm, I don't think I'm doing so much math. It's more like life experience where like these things tend to surprise you. They are a little more complex than you think they are. That's why there's human error and there is, umm, it's like not as simple to say there is a 50% chance of it happening because there is ... I mean, even in this when there is no human error because it's just the computer doing it, it's like each independent trial has its own probability, so it's not like if we were to make a million turtles, so if we changed it to 100 turtles.
[00:21:23] Interviewer: You don't need to do that. You can do that but let's not do that because we will run this version more. 
[00:21:32] Participant: OK. But I think that would make a bigger difference than running this to a million. 
[00:21:37] Interviewer: Oh, I see. So you said that instead of running 10 turtles, making it 100 turtles will be better. 
[00:21:45] Participant: Yeah. 
[00:21:47] Interviewer: But when I asked what is the difference between flipping one coin over and over again and flipping 10 coins simultaneously, you said it's the same thing. 
[00:21:57] Participant: Yeah. This will mean that you won't need a million ticks because you can get to the same amount of trials faster. 
[00:22:06] Interviewer: But, I can say that 100 turtles will run slower than 10 turtles and it will be equalized. 
[00:22:16] Participant: Ok, yeah, that's a good point. 
[00:22:17] Interviewer: So, that's why I did not want you to change that number if that's the only difference, if the speed is the only difference. 
[00:22:23] Participant: Yeah it's only the speed. I don't want to wait till it goes to a million. 
[00:22:26] Interviewer: So when we go to a million, you think that it's going to be closer to 50-50? 
[00:22:30] Participant: Than it is now, yeah. 
[00:22:32] Interviewer: Let's try let's go to 1 million. And please just tell me what you think as you are running the model. 
[00:22:40] Participant: It's like fluctuating up and down, so like this nine isn't changing because every time it goes up to six it goes back to under 5, and 0 isn't changing because it's between 3 and 2. So like it's reaching an asymptote in the fourth or fifth decimal point as opposed to over here which is what I expected. And even when I round it this is still.
[00:23:12] Interviewer: So, it exceeded 1 million, right? 
[00:23:13] Participant: Oh yeah .
[00:23:16] Interviewer: Let's keep going. What do you think will happen? 
[00:23:20] Participant: I mean I'm really hoping that it gets to 50-50 because that's what my theory tells what will happen, but it doesn't so I can't really explain it. 
[00:23:27] Interviewer: Do you only have the theory to explain that? Or do you only rely to theory to explain that? Or do you have alternative explanations? 
[00:23:38] Participant: When I normally when something does not match the theory, so yeah it's dropping now. It's now 49.0% and 50.9%.
[00:23:50] Interviewer: So what will happen if you run this forever? 
[00:23:52] Participant: To infinity? I think it should get to .5 and .5. I mean it's already pretty close to that. Umm, I guess I don't just think of it as theory but normally when things don't fit the theory it's because of like human error or mistake. So, I can't rely on that when it's computer. So like it's easy to think of reasons why it would not work when it's not on a computer, but it would be like it's the weight of my hand, the placement of the coin, or whatever. But for this I don't have those features to fall back on. So, it's just ... 
[00:24:29] Interviewer: So, do you think theory should work here 100%? Do you think like what theory says should be true? 
[00:24:37] Participant: Yeah. I think so based on how we wrote the code? 
[00:24:39] Interviewer: I see but it's not happening? 
[00:24:41] Participant: Oh, it's really close, and it just dropped down again, and it's really really close. 
[00:24:47] Interviewer: Is it close enough? 
[00:24:48] Participant: Yeah. I mean ... 
[00:24:50] Interviewer: But I mean it's not 50% and 49% is actually ... 
[00:24:55] Participant: But 51 and 49 is like only 1% difference. 
[00:24:57] Interviewer: I see. So it's not a big difference for you? 
[00:24:59] Participant: I mean, see that's the thing where I get, confuse is the wrong word, but when I do stuff in the lab then there's always percent error and like plus or minus this. So, to me, something like 49 and 51 seems very close to me because I know that there is always like a plus or minus wiggle room. Umm, I mean I think if we were to set this up again and press go, it's possible that heads will be stuck at 51 and reds will be stuck at 49.
[00:25:36] Interviewer: OK. Let's do it. 
[00:25:40] Participant: Oh oh. That did not happen. It did not happen. I wonder if switching those two would make a difference.
[00:25:54] Interviewer: Go ahead, do that. 
[00:26:01] Participant: Yeah, it switched.
[00:26:13] Interviewer: What switched? 
[00:26:14] Participant: This used to be 49 and this used to be 51 and now this is 51 and this is 49 when I switched the order of heads and tails in the code.
[00:26:24] Interviewer: So how do you explain this? 
[00:26:28] Participant: It must be a bias in NetLogo I don't know.
[00:26:31] Interviewer: There must be a bias, seriously? 
[00:26:32] Participant: A very small bias. I mean otherwise how can you explain, I guess you have to, I could do multiple trials and see... 
[00:26:40] Interviewer: So do you think NetLogo is failing to give you fair random numbers? 
[00:26:44] A:Yeah because every time I do it, OK, set it up, I did that four times and here is the fifth time, every time this is skewed a little bit lower.  Seven, eight, nine, ten ...
[00:27:02] Interviewer: Have you ever noticed that in NetLogo? 
[00:27:04] Participant: No, I have not but then if I do it this way just as a trial, umm, now heads is the lower one. One, two, three, four....
[00:27:25] Interviewer: So it favors the second one, right? 
[00:27:29] Participant: Yeah, no, it favors the first one, yeah. 
[00:27:35] Interviewer: But I mean can this be possible in real world randomness? Can this be how randomness actually works but theory just fools us? Is theory fooling us or is computer fooling us? 
[00:27:46] Participant: I think the computer is fooling us. 
[00:27:49] Interviewer: How? 
[00:27:50] Participant: Because I think theory would say that, at least it's how I imagine it, that neither one is first, right? It's not like heads comes first or tails comes first, they both exist simultaneously.
[00:28:03] Interviewer: But how does theory finds it out? How do we build those theories? How do we make sure that it's equally possible? 
[00:28:15] Participant: I guess you have to test theory. There has to be some relationship. 
[00:28:20] Interviewer: I see. Aren't we testing theory right now? 
[00:28:23] Participant: Yeah. I guess so but it does not make sense to me the first one would always be favored. 
[00:28:30] Interviewer: Hmm. So if it was 49 and 51 but it switched, and switched and switched would you say that ...
[00:28:43] Participant: Yeah. I would just say that. Like if every time I press setup no matter what order they were on the code, like this was always switching and one was always around 49 and one was always 51, than I'd be like "OK, that makes sense", but because it's consistently always the first one that's 51 and the second one is 49, it makes me feel like there's something with the computer. I don't know if that's true.
