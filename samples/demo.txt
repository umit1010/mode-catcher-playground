[00:01:53] Participant: Yeah I, I was thinking about how I, because, I was looking at the model that you sent me. And like, it, uh it kept, I noticed, it kept increasing a lot, with as far as my population of the fish. So, um, I guess, like, I wanted to ask some things to target that.
[00:02:19] Interviewer: Mm hmm.
[00:02:20] Participant: And I was thinking, like, maybe, there could be more fisherman, maybe a couple, maybe, like, three more fishermen, to just randomly come in, because, I mean, I would think that's how it is in real life, with those different numbers of people to come in, so, probably more fishermen.
[00:02:42] Interviewer: Mm hmm. Do you see my screen, by the way right now?
[00:02:50] Participant: Yeah, I can see.
[00:02:51] Interviewer: Perfect, yeah, just to make sure. Yeah, and you are continuing your talk? Sorry, I interrupted.
[00:02:57] Participant: And another thing is, like, a bigger pond, I guess, to, like, because, you know, in my head, there's like 20 some fish, but because they're populating, it makes sense there to be more, so, yeah, bigger pond would, would fit that. And then, my last thing that I want, that I wrote down here to add, um, it's like between, you know, it's like slow or decrease or have some type of realistic effect of the fish population. I was thinking of, maybe a crocodile or something, to add a new type of fishy amphibian of some kind.
[00:03:48] Interviewer: Yeah that would be fun. Like, like it's not just humans catching fish, but there's, there's also, like, an ecosystem. Right, yeah. Let's start with this, <CODING> Do you prefer this much larger one or?
[00:04:44] Participant: Yeah, I like this one, cause you can really see the focus of everything, yeah.
[00:04:50] Interviewer: Perfect, <CODING>. Is it better to be a bit more irregular like this?
[00:05:04] Participant: Yeah, that's fine.
[00:05:05] Interviewer: Yeah, <REVIEWING>. Are they always staying here, or are they coming and going at times?
[00:05:22] Participant: Um, I would think the five fishermen, would, you know, maybe, they're coming and going, but, but then, they're like, maybe, three other fishermen that, that you know they have. They come by random, so sometimes there would be, I guess, there would be between eight and five. Five that definitely come, but the other three are random.
[00:05:51] Interviewer: So that will be something, like, let me show you how I implemented your idea. <CONFIRMING> Does it, does it work the way you want?
[00:06:24] Participant: Yeah, that's cool.
[00:06:26] Interviewer: And now, let's make the fishermen come and go at random. Do they come and go at random times, or periodically? Is there, like, a specific interval?
[00:06:34] Participant: Umm, I would think, like, maybe, I don't know, how you put this, but maybe, like, as it goes to nighttime or like even in time, like, you know, I don't know, how that would because there's no sky.
